About Me

I once was a software developer, I am still one by heart, but my career drove me away from code more then I wanted to. 

I discovered a new passion though, it's building new teams. So I will call myself a "Software Team Builder" from now on. That pretty much sums up what I do. I start at companies with No or Small teams, I inhale the application domain, I start hiring staff, I introduce tools, process and work style.
